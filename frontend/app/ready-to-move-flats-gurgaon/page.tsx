      faqs={[
        { q: 'Is there GST on ready-to-move flats in Gurgaon?', a: 'No. Ready-to-move properties with a valid Occupancy Certificate (OC) or Completion Certificate (CC) are exempt from GST. This saves 5% compared to under-construction properties where GST is applicable. This is one of the biggest advantages of buying ready-to-move in Gurgaon.' },
        { q: 'What is the advantage of buying ready-to-move over under-construction in Gurgaon?', a: 'Key advantages: (1) Zero GST saves 5% of property value; (2) No construction delay risk; (3) Immediate possession and rental income; (4) Actual flat inspection before purchase; (5) Faster home loan disbursement; (6) No risk of builder default on construction.' },
        { q: 'Which areas in Gurgaon have the most ready-to-move flats?', a: 'Ready-to-move inventory is highest in: Dwarka Expressway Sectors 102, 104, 108 (Sobha City, BPTP); Golf Course Extension Road Sectors 65–70 (Emaar, Bestech); Sohna Road Sectors 47–50 (Vatika City, DLF); and Sector 37D (DDJAY ready homes).' },
        { q: 'Are ready-to-move flats in Gurgaon more expensive?', a: 'Yes, typically 10–15% more than new launches. However, the 5% GST saving partially offsets this. When you factor in the elimination of GST, lower risk and immediate income potential, RTM often works out to similar or better value than an under-construction home.' },
