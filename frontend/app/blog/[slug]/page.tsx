No other Gurgaon corridor has this airport anchor.\n\nSecond, the Delhi border constraint at 2 km means supply is permanently limited. All new supply must come from vertical development — this structural scarcity is the single most powerful price driver.\n\nThird, Metro Phase II will add 15–20% premium the moment it becomes operational (expected 2026–27). Smart money is buying before this catalyst.\n\nPrice trajectory: ₹5,200/sqft (2021) → ₹9,500–13,000/sqft (2025) — a 45–60% increase backed by end-user demand.", link: '/dwarka-expressway-projects', linkText: 'View All Dwarka Expressway Projects →' },

Calculate carpet area price — RERA mandates carpet area disclosure.\n\nMistake 3: Not checking RERA complaints.
