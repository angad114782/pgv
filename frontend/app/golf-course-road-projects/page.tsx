        { q: 'What is the difference between Golf Course Road (GCR) and Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) in Gurgaon?', a: 'Golf Course Road (GCR) runs from DLF Cyber City through Sectors 42–56 — it is the original luxury belt established by DLF in the early 2000s. Golf Course Extension Road (GCER) extends further towards Sohna from Vatika Chowk, through sectors 57–75. GCR is more established and premium, GCER is newer with higher appreciation potential.' },
        { q: 'What are the best projects on Golf Course Road Gurgaon?', a: 'Top projects on Golf Course Road include: DLF The Camellias (ultra-luxury penthouse, ₹40–100 Cr), DLF The Magnolias (luxury 4 BHK, ₹15–40 Cr), DLF The Crest (Sector 54, 3/4 BHK, ₹5–15 Cr), Tulip Monsella (Sector 54, 4 BHK, ₹8–25 Cr) and Oberoi Sky Heights (3/4 BHK, ₹8–20 Cr).' },
        { q: 'What is the price per sqft on Golf Course Road Gurgaon?', a: 'Golf Course Road commands ₹20,000–₹50,000 per sqft depending on the project. DLF Camellias is at ₹45,000–₹55,000/sqft. Mid-luxury projects like DLF The Crest are at ₹20,000–₹25,000/sqft. New launches on adjacent sectors (42, 43) start at ₹15,000/sqft.' },
        { q: 'Is Golf Course Road good for investment in 2025?', a: 'GCR is best for capital preservation and long-term wealth creation rather than short-term flipping. Luxury properties here have given 200–300% returns in 10 years. However, entry prices are very high (₹3 Cr+). For pure investment returns, Golf Course Extension Road may offer better near-term upside at lower entry prices.' },
